Given an integer `x`, return **true** if `x` is a palindrome, and **false** otherwise.

## Example 1:

- Input: x = 121
- Output: true
- Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## Example 2:

- Input: x = -121
- Output: false
- Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

## Example 3:

- Input: x = 10
- Output: false
- Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 
## Constraints:

- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
