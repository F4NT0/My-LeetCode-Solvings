You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

## Example 1:

- Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
- Output: "e"
- Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

## Example 2:

- Input: s = "", t = "y"
- Output: "y"
 

## Constraints:

- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
