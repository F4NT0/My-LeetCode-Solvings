Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 
## Example 1:

- Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
- Output: true

## Example 2:

- Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
- Output: false

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
